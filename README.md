# ML-Based Combinational Depth and Timing Violation Predictor

## Overview
Timing analysis is a critical step in chip design, ensuring that signals meet required constraints. The traditional approach relies on post-synthesis reports, which are computationally expensive and time-consuming.

This project proposes an AI-driven approach to predict combinational logic depth for given RTL signals before synthesis, allowing for early timing violation detection. We leverage machine learning models trained on RTL design data to estimate logic depth efficiently. This method significantly reduces design iteration cycles, enhances debugging speed, and improves overall project execution time.

## Problem Statement
Timing analysis is essential in digital circuit design to ensure signals meet required constraints. Timing violations occur when a signal's combinational logic depth exceeds the allowable limit for a given clock cycle. Traditional post-synthesis analysis is slow, often taking hours or days for large designs, delaying debugging and optimization.

This project introduces an AI-driven approach to predict combinational logic depth in RTL modules before synthesis. By training machine learning models on RTL design data, we provide fast, accurate estimates, significantly reducing timing validation time.

Designed for hardware engineers and chip design companies, our solution enables early detection of potential timing violations, minimizing design iterations, accelerating development, and improving efficiency in semiconductor design.
